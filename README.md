# parser-for-10-k
parser for 10-k, it was my homework for python, well some of my teammates didn't help, I still got it done by myself, with a lot times of course.
This code focus on parsing 10-k and find specific items in 10-k report, I also do a sentiment analysis.
I tried my best to make my code clear and concise.
